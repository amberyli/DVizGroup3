# Background

On the 3rd of May, a huge fire accident broke out at at Platt's Eyot in Hampton, south-west London, and destroyed two Grade-II listed boatyards on a River Thames island.

Another famous case, which is called Grenfell Tower fire, happened on 14th of June 2017. It caused 72 deaths and more than 70 others were injured.

These incidents have led us to look at the hard work of London fire brigade.

# Our Aim

However, due to the lack of expression of their contribution, the corresponding understanding is often not clear.

Then we intended to make 4 visualisastions of show it, both specificly and comprehensively.
